# GitHub Onboarding

This document will help you get access to the Big Fish Games GitHub organizations. The two organizations are:

- [github.com/bigfishgames](https://github.com/bigfishgames) organization is for internal Big Fish employees.
- [github.com/bigfishgames-external](https://github.com/bigfishgames-external) organization contains game code and is intended for collaborations between external developers and Big Fish.

:::tip[Pre-Requisite]

The developer should have a Big Fish email address and be granted permission to GitHub Enterprise Cloud in Okta before performing these steps. 

In rare cases, a user may not have a Big Fish email address. If approved, users without Big Fish addresses can be “invited” to join the organization using their own email address. 

:::

## Create a GitHub account

If you already have a GitHub.com account associated with your @bigfishgames.com email address, as either the Primary or Backup, skip to the next step **Get Okta access**.

1. Enter a username of your choice. At Big Fish, we recommend using the syntax: ``firstname-lastname-bfg``. Please note that this username is **globally visible** and must be unique.
2. Pick a secure password. This password should be different from your Okta password.
3. Enable two-factor authentication. **NOTE: Two-factor authentication is required for all accounts.**
4. Check your email for an account verification email from GitHub and complete the verification process.

GitHub profile details such as profile picture and location are **publicly visible**. Do not post any details to your public GitHub profile that you don't want to become public.

## Get Okta access

While the GitHub account itself is not managed by Okta, access to Big Fish Games code, organizations, repositories, and teams is managed by Okta.

In many cases, this step is already completed for you. To verify you have access to Okta:

1. Go to [https://aristocrat.okta.com/app/UserHome](https://aristocrat.okta.com/app/UserHome) and sign in with your Big Fish Games Okta account.
2. Locate the GitHub icon.
3. If you have the icon, proceed to the next step **Link your Okta and GitHub accounts**.

If the icon is missing, send an email to [Big Fish Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@bigfishgames.com) asking to be added to the appropriate group (either OKTA ``Users-GHC Org bigfishgames-external`` or ``OKTA Users-GHC Org bigfishgames``). Please note that it may take a few days for the request to be approved and completed by Help Desk.

## Link your Okta and GitHub account

1. Go to [https://aristocrat.okta.com/app/UserHome](https://aristocrat.okta.com/app/UserHome) and click on the GitHub tile.
2. Log in with the GitHub account associated with your @bigfishgames.com email address.
3. Complete the single sign-on flow as prompted.

## Get added to the correct teams

After your Okta account is paired with the Big Fish Games GitHub organization, you need to be added to the appropriate teams in GitHub. Internal employees should contact your team lead; external collaborators should contact their producers to get added to the appropriate teams.
