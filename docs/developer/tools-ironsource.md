# ironSource

ironSource allows an app to implement ad delivery services using several ad networks (Facebook, TapJoy, UnityAds, Vungle, etc.), all housed within the framework of one single 3rd party SDK. It handles logic to serve the most effective ads to the client automatically. ironSource supports rewarded videos, interstitials, and banners.

:::info

The ironSource SDK is not included in the BFG SDK and needs to be integrated separately.
