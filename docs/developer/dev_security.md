# In-App Messaging with Leanplum

Leanplum comes with several in-app messaging templates out of the box to manage different types of messages including alerts, confirmations, offers, and other interstitial popup messages. Leanplum leverages the existing framework based on your platform, allowing you to use out-of-box solutions, customize your messages with the provided templates, or create your own.

## Enabling In-App Messaging 

To enable in-app messaging, ensure that the Leanplum SDK is integrated into your game code. Once integrated, run your application at least once in development mode to ensure it is working correctly.

Currently, In-App messages cannot be triggered by events via Leanplum's REST API. Instead, events must be triggered and come from the client with the SDK installed.
