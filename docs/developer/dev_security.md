# Configure the Unity SDK

The BFG SDK config file, bfg_config.json, provides the basic settings that will be used during the launch of your game. In addition, it enables optional features within your game and configures settings that are specific to the BFG SDK. 

For Unity games, you will need a separate config file for each platform you are developing on. This means that if your game is for both Android and iOS devices, then you will two config files: one for Android and another for iOS. 

For iOS Targets, the config file, bfg_config.json must be located somewhere in the application bundle.

For Android Targets, the config file, bfg_config.json must be located in the /src/main/res/raw folder in the exported Android Studio project.

:::warning

The config file, bfg_config.json is required for the BFG SDK to function. If the BFG SDK cannot find the file, then your game will crash on startup.

:::

## JSON Structure 

The config file, bfg_config.json is a JSON file broken down into sections based on their configuration area:

| **Section Name** | **Required / Optional** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
| **core** | Required | Settings that identify, set up and configure the game |
| **rave** | Required | Settings that configure identity and authentication using Rave |
| **tacklebox_marketing** | Optional | Settings used to integrate our TackleBox marketing platform<br /><br />NOTE: Please use this for backwards compatibility only. Newer apps should use LeanPlum and/or brainCloud for Marketing functionality. |
| **user_authentication** | Optional | Settings for optional features related to user authentication |
| **appsflyer** | Optional | Settings for AppsFlyer install attribution |
| **gdpr** | Optional | Settings for testing GDPR and other policies |
| **zendesk** | Optional | Settings to configure the Zendesk help center |
| **debugging** | Optional | Settings that enable various SDK debug features |

### Required Sections

These sections must be included in the config file of every game using the BFG SDK, otherwise, it will crash upon initialization.

<details>
  <summary>Core</summary>

The **Core** section contains settings that are integral to your game, such as the app name and the platforms the game will be distributed on. The values will differ based on platform (Android vs iOS):

```json
"core": {
  "app_name": "...",
  "app_store": "..."
},
```

| **Value Name** | **Platform** | **Required / Optional** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **app_name** | iOS<br />Android | Required | The English human readable name for your game, such as "Gummy Drop!" or "Fairway Solitaire". The ``app_name`` is used for reporting in Big Fish data analytics and user acquisition. Confirm with your Big Fish producer what to use for your app name.<br /><br />**NOTE**: In order to identify your game consistently, all non-alphanumeric characters must be removed from the app name. On Android platforms, this is done automatically by the BFG SDK and no further configuration is needed. However, if you are developing for iOS, then you must remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the name in your game code. |
| **app_store** | Android | Required | A string value that should be set to either "google" or "amazon" depending on which App Store the APK is being deployed to. |
| **app_store_id** | iOS | Required | The identifier given to your game in Apple's App Store Connect portal. Confirm your ``app_store_id`` with your Big Fish producer. |
| **custom_events_enabled** | iOS | Optional | A Boolean flag that enables/disables custom event reporting. This value defaults to ``true`` if not specified. Check with your Big Fish producer before setting this value to ``false``. |
| **hbi** | iOS | Optional | A identifier that stands for Hashed Bundle Identifier. This value is used as an anti-fraud measure. The BFG SDK checks to verify the bundle ID is correct when the purchase service is initialized and will also verify the bundle ID and product ID found in receipts.<br /><br />If your game does not enable In-App Purchasing, this value is optional and defaults to ``nil`` if not specified.<br /><br />**NOTE**: The hbi value is required for In-App Purchasing. If your app supports In-App Purchasing, ensure that this value is specified in your config file. Confirm your ``hbi`` with your Big Fish producer. |

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Rave</summary>

The Rave section is passed directly to the Rave SDK as part of the BFG SDK initialization. It has several different configuration values, but the ``ApplicationID`` is the only one that is required. Confirm your ``ApplicationID`` with your Big Fish producer.

```json
"rave": {
  "RaveSettings.General.ApplicationID": "..."
},
```

A full list of Rave configuration values is available on Raveâ€™s documentation: 
- [Available Settings (iOS)](https://bf-docs.ravesocial.co/ios.html#available-settings)
