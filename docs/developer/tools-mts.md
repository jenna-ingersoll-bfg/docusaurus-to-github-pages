# Mobile Telemetry Services (MTS)

Mobile Telemetry Service (MTS) is an analytics gathering method developed by Big Fish Games. MTS is integrated directly into the BFG SDK to gather data; the data is then sent to [AppsFlyer](./tools-appsflyer) to assist in:

- Campaigns and advertisements for the user
- Tracking install/uninstall rates
- A/B Testing
- Collecting sales data

MTS helps developers and support engineers debug and resolve technical issues, as well as track key performance indicators (KPIs).
