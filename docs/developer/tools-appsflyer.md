# AppsFlyer

AppsFlyer is a marketing and data analytics tool that gives visibility into campaign performance and app installs, while providing deep linking solutions.

With AppsFlyer, you can:

- Track and attribute the install and post-install events for all marketing channels
- Create deep links from within your game
- Measure the success of your game’s campaigns
- Optimize campaign spending

AppsFlyer is integrated directly into the BFG SDK, and most of the functionality such as tracking, privacy protection, and data analytics requires no additional setup (aside from the BFG SDK). However, you may be granted access to the AppsFlyer dashboard, which allows you to view the incoming data and create custom deep links.
