# brainCloud

Big Fish has partnered with brainCloud to provide a back-end server technology that gets your game up and running quickly with user monitoring, social player interactions, in-game messaging and much more. brainCloud’s services make it easy to develop mobile and social games, adding comprehensive tools to support your team during development, testing, and user support.

brainCloud is not included in the BFG SDK and needs to be integrated separately.

## Setting up brainCloud 

Big Fish has a private instance of brainCloud, hosted on GCP, that supports all of our games using brainCloud. Once you have committed to using brainCloud for one or more features, your Big Fish producer will set up an instance that will contain all of the cloud server code and features unique to your game.

In addition, your Big Fish producer will send an invitations to all team members so that they can access the brainCloud instance.

Contact your Big Fish Producer if you need access to a brainCloud instance or you need a new instance for your game.

## Logging into brainCloud 

Once you have accepted the invitation:

1. Log into Big Fish’s [brainCloud server](https://portal.bc.bigfishgames.com).
2. Choose the instance you’d like to view. This will be unique to the team you are working on.

## The brainCloud Design Portal 

No matter what role you serve in the game development process, you will access all of brainCloud’s features using their Design Portal. The Design Portal combines four powerful tools into one:

- A design tool that allows you to create, configure and define your applications.
- An expansive API Explorer that allows you to query your configured application dynamically without writing code.
- A monitoring interface that provide easy debugging of global and user data.
- A visual analytics and reporting tool to help understand the usage and performance of your application.

For more information on using brainCloud’s Design Portal, see their [Design Portal Tutorials](https://getbraincloud.com/apidocs/portal-usage).

## brainCloud Features 

You are free to use any of the features provided by brainCloud’s back-end services. Keep in mind, however, that the cost of using brainCloud is dependent upon your game’s usage of the server calls. It is the responsibility of your team to figure out how to most efficiently use the features offered by this service.

Here are some key features our games are currently using with brainCloud’s services:

- User Monitoring
- Player Experience and Leveling
- Purchasing and Gifting
- Item Management
- Redemption Codes
- Tournaments and Leaderboards
- In-Game Messaging
