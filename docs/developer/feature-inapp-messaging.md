## What is In-App Messaging? 

**In-app messages** are targeted messages that pop up for a player when they are actively using your app. Most of the time, in-app messages encourage the player to complete a task, such as completing a level or buying an item. 

Games published by Big Fish use **Leanplum** to create and display in-app messages. Leanplum comes with several in-app messaging templates out of the box to manage different types of messages including alerts, confirmations, offers, and other interstitial popup messages. When creating a new in-app message, you can customize not only the text of your message, but also the look and feel (colors, images, size, etc).

Because LeanPlum is not included in the BFG SDK, you need to integrate it separately into your game code.

## Enabling In-App Messaging 

To enable in-app messaging, ensure that the Leanplum SDK is integrated into your game code. Once integrated, run your application at least once in development mode to ensure it is working correctly.

:::info

Currently, In-App messages cannot be triggered by events via Leanplum's REST API. Instead, events must be triggered and come from the client with the SDK installed.
