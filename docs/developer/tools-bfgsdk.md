# BFG SDK

The BFG SDKs support game developers by interfacing with Big Fish platform services and surfacing mobile-specific APIs and features. All games going through Big Fishâ€™s publishing pipeline are required to integrate the BFG SDK.

There are three SDKs available:

- The **Unity SDK** is used for all Unity-based mobile games, and supports both Android and iOS devices.
- The native **Android SDK** and **iOS SDK** are maintained for use with our older games already live on the app stores.
