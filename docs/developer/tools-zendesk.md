# Zendesk

Zendesk is a customer service platform that allows users to view help articles and file support tickets directly inside the game.

Zendesk is integrated directly into the BFG SDK. When filing a ticket, the BFG SDK passes data such as a RaveID and device info to Big Fish Customer Support (CS), helping them diagnose and resolve issues with your game.
