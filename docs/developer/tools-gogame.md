# GoGame

GoGame is a telemetry developed by Plarium that allows the User Acquisition (UA) team to plan and monitor marketing spending. It has complete write access to changes in budgets, bids, and business rules that can directly impact the business of your application.

GoGame receives telemetry data from the Mobile Telemetry Service (MTS) events from your application. When your application is configured correctly in GoGame, the system automatically detects the MTS events and converts them into GoGameâ€™s API payload format. Once converted, the payload is sent to GoGame.

Besides the setup with the User Acquisition (UA) team, GoGame telemetry is automatic. Having GoGame operation in your application depends on properly integrating the BFG SDK in the applications.
